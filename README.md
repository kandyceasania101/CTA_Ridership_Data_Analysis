# CTA_Ridership_Data_Analysis

​​This is a project assigned by one of my CS courses at UIC. In this project I analyze a database of ridership about Chicago;s CTA system. The CTA database contains 5 tables. I access each table using SQL queries and C#. There is a self-designed windows application GUI to view this data.
